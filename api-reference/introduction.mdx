## Setting Up

To access Black Swan APIs, you'll need an API Key for authentication. Follow these steps:

- **Dashboard**: Request through the service portal.

Please include:
- Your organization's name
- Use case (e.g., "credit scoring for SME loans")
- Expected request volume (e.g., "100 calls/minute")

### 2. Receive Your Credentials

After approval, you'll receive:
- A unique **Production API Key** (e.g., `bsa_live_123456789abcdef`)
- A **Sandbox Key** for testing (if applicable)
- Documentation links and rate limits

### 3. Integrate the API

Include your API Key in the `Authorization` header:
